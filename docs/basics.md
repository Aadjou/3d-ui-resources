## UI/UX Design Principles

**VR Interface Design Manifesto**

A declaration of intent for the research and design of user interfaces for ergonomic
multitasking in virtual reality, focused primarily on the interaction design
of operating systems and browsers. The purpose of this manifesto is to explain
intent as well as individual bias, assumptions, and reasons.

**Taking the leap from 2d to 3d**

Haejin Lee describes her experience transitioning from a 2D flatland designer
to a 3D experience designer in her first year after she joined the HoloLens team.
Read about why transferring 2D thinking into 3D space does not work and what are
the unique properties thinking in 3D space and why prototyping is important in 3D.

*Keywords:* Diegetic UI, world-locked / body-locked elements, skeumorphism,
magical interaction, teleportation, user is actor

**Principles of good UX for AR**

Environmental design is the context in people will be engaging with your application.
Imagine looking through a ‘window’ into an enhanced (augmented) environment.
Whatever context Users are currently in is the environment! How do you make sure the
experiences you design are easy to use, memorable, and leave a lasting impression?

*Keywords:* Environmental Design, AR objects, ergonomics, comfort, empathy

**The VR Book**

Without a clear understanding of the human side of virtual reality,
the experience will always fail. The VR Book: Human-Centered Design for
Virtual Reality bridges this gap.

## Differences between 2D and 3D UI Design

**Gamasutra Game UI Discoveries**

Traditional HUDs live under constant scrutiny in ongoing efforts to make the
UI as transparent as possible, allowing the player to immerse themselves into the game.
This article describes how we can put the interface in the real world.

*Keywords:* diegetic, non-diegetic, meta, spatial UI

**Designing Screen Interfaces for VR**

When we think of VR, our minds naturally gravitate towards three-dimensional
environments and interactions. But, there are times when it’s necessary to present content in a two-dimensional way. With VR, we have the opportunity to reevaluate the nature of screens, and how we view and interact with screen-based content. This talk will cover techniques the Daydream team uses to create legible, usable screen interfaces in VR. We will introduce new workflows, new units, and highlight interaction opportunities and pitfalls.
