## Understanding of spatial changes and spatial thinking

The following 3D scene show the ruins of the ancient monuments of Palmyra,
an UNESCO World Heritage Site that has been destroyed during the Syrian
Civil War in 2015.
The text gives us an idea of what happened. But the 3d model gives us an
instant immersive idea of what happened. Both are useful in a different way.

Using Microsoft HoloLens, service technicians will be able to visualize
and identify problems with elevators ahead of a job, and have remote, hands-free
access to technical and expert information when onsite – all resulting in significant
savings in time and stress.

This demo uses a force-directed graph to visualize data
Data visualization in VR/AR is quite exciting, opening up new opportunities
for feeling and experiencing the data — not just seeing it.
