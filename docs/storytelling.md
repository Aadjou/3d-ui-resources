**Interactive Stories and Video Game Art: A Storytelling Framework for Game Design**

The success of storytelling in games depends on the entire development team ―
game designers, artists, writers, programmers and musicians, etc.― working
harmoniously together towards a singular artistic vision. Interactive Stories
and Video Game Art is first to define a common design language for understanding
and orchestrating interactive masterpieces using techniques inherited from
the rich history of art and craftsmanship that games build upon.
